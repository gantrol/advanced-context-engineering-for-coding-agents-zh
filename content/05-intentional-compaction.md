## Intentional Compaction: Your First Power Move

You've probably already discovered this technique without naming it. As your context fills up, you pause and ask:

> "Write everything we did so far to progress.md, ensure to note the end goal, the approach we're taking, the steps we've done so far, and the current failure we're working on"

### What Makes Good Compaction

A good compaction artifact includes:

- **The Goal** - What we're trying to achieve
- **Key Discoveries** - What we've learned about the codebase
- **Current Approach** - The strategy we're pursuing
- **Completed Steps** - What's already done
- **Current State** - Where we are now
- **Next Steps** - What comes next

### Alternative: Commit Message Compaction

You can also [use commit messages for intentional compaction](https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/1961490837017088051). Each commit becomes a checkpoint you can return to with full context.

### Why This Works

Intentional compaction works because it:

1. **Removes Noise** - Failed attempts and dead ends don't clutter future context
2. **Preserves Learning** - Key discoveries and decisions are captured
3. **Creates Checkpoints** - You can always restart from a known good state
4. **Enables Collaboration** - Others can pick up where you left off

### The Limitation

But manual compaction has a problem: you only do it when things get bad. By then, you've already wasted tokens and time on a polluted context.

What if we made compaction not a rescue operation, but the core workflow?
