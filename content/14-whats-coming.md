## What's Coming: The Post-IDE World

### The Commoditization of Coding Agents

I'm reasonably confident that coding agents will be commoditized. Every major player will have one. They'll all be roughly equivalent in capability.

The differentiator won't be the agent. It'll be how you use it.

### The Real Challenge: Transformation

The hard part will be the team and workflow transformation. Everything about collaboration changes in a world where AI writes 99% of code:

- **Meetings** become spec reviews
- **Documentation** becomes prompts
- **Code reviews** become plan reviews
- **Debugging** becomes research steering
- **Architecture** becomes context design

### The Competitive Reality

I believe pretty strongly: if you don't figure this out, you're gonna get lapped by someone who did.

This isn't about being an early adopter. It's about fundamental capability. Teams that can ship 10x faster with the same quality will win. Period.

### What We're Building

We're bullish on spec-first, agentic workflows. We're building tools to make it easier.

The key challenge: scaling "frequent intentional compaction" workflows across large teams. How do you:
- Share research across engineers?
- Maintain plan consistency?
- Track spec evolution?
- Coordinate parallel work?

### CodeLayer: Superhuman for Claude Code

On Tuesday, we're launching CodeLayer in private beta. Think "Superhuman for Claude Code."

If you're:
- A fan of Superhuman and/or vim mode
- Ready to move beyond "vibe coding"
- Serious about building with agents

### For Engineering Leaders

We're forward-deploying with everyone from 6-person startups to 1000-employee public companies. Helping teams make the culture/process/tech shift to AI-first coding.

The tech is 20% of the challenge. The transformation is 80%.

### The Future Is Already Here

Our team of 3 is averaging $12k/month on Opus. Our intern shipped 10 PRs on day 8. We're fixing bugs in codebases we've never seen.

This isn't the future. This is now.

The question isn't whether AI will write most code. It's whether you'll be the one directing it.

### Final Thought

Remember: there's no magic prompt. This isn't about tricks or hacks. It's about engineering discipline applied to a new problem space.

The teams that win will be the ones that treat AI coding as an engineering discipline, not a magic black box.

Welcome to the post-IDE world. It's going to be wild.
